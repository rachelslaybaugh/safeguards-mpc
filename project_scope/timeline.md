# Thesis timeline

## Pre-Quals

### Grammar Compression Background
___January 31, 2018___

* Understand the how grammar compression is used to reduce the volume of data and detect anomalies. 
* Determine whether existing grammar compression tools are sufficient for our project (if not, reproduce them; timeline may need to be adjusted). 
* Demonstrate successful reapplication of grammar compression/anomaly detection algorithm on cardiogram (or other similarly accessbile dataset), potentially customized for use by our own future code. 

### MPC Background
___March 31, 2019___

* Thoroughly understand how multiparty computation can be used to compute algorithms on hidden data.
* Develop demonstrations of MPC on progressively more complicated datasets (i.e. canonical example, larger datasets, full time series, grammar-compressed time series)
	* Structure as a full Python code for use in later stages


### Proof of Concept 
___October 31, 2019___

* Develop a full implementation of MPC on a grammar compressed cardiogram
	* Prove calculation result is correct
	* Prove all input data remains anonymous
* Potentially perform size/speed analysis to determine scalability

### Writing Theisis
___May 31, 2021___
